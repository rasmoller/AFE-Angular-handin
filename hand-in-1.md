# Credit Card Management System
## SWAFE 2021 – Hand in 1
## Introduction
We have been contacted by a new client who runs a consultant business. Each of their consultants has a company credit card, and they want to keep track of expenses for each credit card. They have drafted with a requirement specification for a credit card management system.

The solution will provide the accounting department with an overview of use for each credit card. Accountants can add new credit cards and remove them when after they have expired or is lost. It will also be possible to check transaction details for each credit card, as well as searching in transactions across all registered cards.

# Credit card server documentation
**Installation** 
1. Run `npm install` in `hand-in/credit-card-server`
2. Run `npm start` in `hand-in/credit-card-server`

The server is running @ http://localhost:3000

**Available endpoint**
- `GET /credit_cards`—returns an array of credit cards
- `POST /credit_cards`—creates a credit card
- `GET /transactions`—returns an array of transactions
- `POST /transactions`—creates a transaction
- `DELETE /credit_cards/:card_number`–deletes a credit card
- `DELETE /transactions/:transaction_uid`–deletes a transaction

# Internal notes

## Formalia

- Group size: 1-3 people
- Deadline: 14th October 2022 (2022-10-14)

## Submission
Before submitting your solution, do the following:
1. Delete the `node_modules` folder in the workspace root folder
2. Add a file `participants.txt` and insert a new line for each participant with the AUID and name of each member separated by whitespace
3. Add `participants.txt` to the root folder of your application
4. Archive and compress you application using one the following formats: `zip`, or `gzip/tar`. All other formats (`rar`, `7z`, etc.) will result in a request for resubmission
5. The filename should be named `<AUID_PARTICIPANT_1>-<AUID_PARTICIPANT_2>-<AUID_PARTICIPANT_3>.<ARCHIVE_COMPRESS_FORMAT>` _Example: Alice with AUID `au01248` and Bob with AUID `au84210` creates a compressed archive named `au01248-au84210.tar.gz` and uploads it to Brightspace_

Example `participants.txt` contents:
```
au01248 Alice Alison
au84210 Bob Bobson
```
